Pong [Archived]
===============

This piece of code is very close to my heart. This is the very first project and is the very first video game that I programmed. This repo is just an archive of that piece of code which I can keep a track of and look back with nostelgia. This code was written somwhere around the 30th of November 2010. Here are the instructions on how to run this piece of code.

Run `make help` for getting the list of all the make commands

If you're running from linux
----------------------------

P.S. This has only been tested on Linux

1. Make sure you have DosBox installed, that's the key emulator since this is an application implemented in DOS

2. Run `make install` to install the Turbo C 3.X IDE

3. Follow the instructions from the installation wizard. Make sure the IDE is installed in `C:\TC`

4. Run `make run-tc` to run the Turbo C 3.X IDE

5. Open the file `C:\pong.cpp` into your IDE

6. GoTo *Options* -> *Linker* -> *Libraries* and enable the *Graphics* library

7. Run the program, it should start the Pong game

8. Control the paddle with `a` and `z` keys and press `x` to exit the game
